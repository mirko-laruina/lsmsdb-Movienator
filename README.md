# Movienator
Movie rating scraper and aggregator websites build with Java,
MongoDB, Neo4j and Python (scraping) for the third task for the 
course in "Large Scale and Multi-Structured Databases" at the 
University of Pisa.

## Goal
Movienator is a movie rating website written in Java using the 
SpringBoot library that shows movie ratings scraped from other
websites (MyMovies, IMDB) or inserted on the website by users.
The website also provides aggregated statistics to the users.

For more information, refer to the [final report](docs/design_document/design_document.pdf).

## Repository
In the `master` branch, you can find the final code for the project, 
while the `task3` branch contains the updated code for the third 
project (addition of a graph database).
