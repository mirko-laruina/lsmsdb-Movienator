\subsection{Application Overview}
The application is an aggregator of movie reviews and ratings with the purpose 
of providing logged users suggestions based on their previously watched and 
liked movies. Not logged-in users may still use the service to browse movie 
rankings and statistics.

All users can search a movie and view its details (e.g., title, 
original title, duration, cast, ...) along with its reviews and aggregated 
statistics about ratings. 

In addition, all users can browse movie lists such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item alphabetic list of movies
    \item rankings based on ratings
    \item movies currently in movie theaters
\end{itemize} 

Over these lists the user can apply filters based on, for example, genre, 
year, casting, etc.

Logged-in users can mark a film as watched and, in that case, to
submit a rating and, optionally, a review. 

Logged-in users can access a private area with suggestions of 
movies to watch, with the possibility of adding filters like year, on theater 
movies, etc.

System administrators can delete unappropriate reviews and ban users.

The movie database will be built upon the publicly available IMDb dataset.

The reviews and ratings will be gathered also from scraping other websites 
(e.g., Rotten Tomatoes, Coming Soon, MyMovies, Google).
